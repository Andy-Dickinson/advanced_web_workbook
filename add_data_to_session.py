# Adding data into a session, query that data, and remove that data
# Flask provides an interface for using 'secured cookies' or sessions from our Python code and we can consider a session to be a small data store for keys and values. 
# However, note the content of a cookie can easily be read by the client or whilst it is transmitted (unless the communication has been secured with HTTPS)
